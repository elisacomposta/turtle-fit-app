By clicking on the **TODAY** button, you can add a new activity.


The app proposes a list of common activities, but you can create your own thanks to the last choice, the activity _Others_.<br>
All set activities are marked by a ⭐, instead of the ➕ symbol.<br>
A useful calendar simplifies selecting the date.<br>

By clicking on the **SHELL** button, you can see the records list.


This page shows the bar chart of the current week, where the value of each day is computed by summing the difficulty level of all activities recorded for that day.<br>
It's possible to select another week by simply clicking on the dates shown above.<br>
If the bar of a specific day is clicked, the statistics about it are shown.<br>
When a certain activity is selected, its description, if provided, is shown at the bottom of the screen.<br>
